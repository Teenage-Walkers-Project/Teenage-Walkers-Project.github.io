<div class="entry-content"><h3>Introduction of Tools for Communication Exchange</h3>

<h4>[Home Page]</h4>

<p>This tool has a feature that you can get same contents from everywhere. We can use it for Self-Introduction, Popular trend, School and Regional Introduction. Comparing with each homepage among participating students will promote opportunities for mutual cultural understanding and cultivate the basis of human relationship. If the home pages contain private information, it should be protected under identification and password system.</p>

<h4>[Bulletin Board]</h4>

<p>This tool which has two useful functions as E-mail and Mailing List will be managed easily in technology matter once it is set up. The functions will work well for group and individual activities among participating students and produce a place to exchange opinions and ideas between them. They can use this tool freely with identification and password system to protect their personal information. Participating schools and the teachers should check the bulletin board regularly and cope with misusing the bulletin board or inadequate messages contributed on it to lead miscommunication.</p>

<h5>Sample Activity</h5>

<p>To keep students&#8217; privacy their names were changed</p>

Dear KIYOMI my dearest best friend<br/>
Hi! Hello! Hi! Konnichiwa. Ogenki desu ka. I am a little sick. My throat really hurts. I am very happy that you received my letter. Did you understand my letter? Do you think I write too much? I am very eager to receive your letter again. I miss you very, very, very much! Is softball fun for you? Do you like playing with your computer? I Love to study Japanese very much. Learning Japanese is very fun. Japanese is more easy to learn than English. I do not know if I will be going to Toshi in the summer time. I do know in the future I will go to Toshi. I wish Toshi was more warm when we had home stay in Toshi. I want to come to Toshi now. The US has very different weather everywhere. There is snow, tornado, rain, or very hot weather. Kyoo wa suiyoobi desu. I understand what days are in Japanese language. I am glad Japanese students are doing fine. I hope you are doing fine too! Will I see you on Kinyoobi at juuji? It will be Getsuyoobi at shiji in NC. I&rsquo;ll see you ashita! Bye-bye!  |<br/>
With Love, Dona</p>

I have read in the newspaper that Japan is in an economic depression. Does this affect you? I know some people in Japan are extremely worried, are you? How serious is it? Our media has exploded it a great deal.<br/>

In Reply to: Economic depression? posted by Ed on November 24, 1998 at 06:14:15:<br/>
Yes, We&rsquo;re in an economic depression at a moment. It&rsquo;s not as common as we feel in our daily life. But many people worry about firing from the company or business depression. Japanese in general tend to save money than to spend them. So This is one thing to make Japan more economically depressed.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll write soon!<br/>

Are people your age involved with helping out your community? Here, some teenagers are very involved. They can do anything from helping out others their age who are in need, younger kids, or elders. They also go and help clean up the neighborhood or other neighborhoods so there is a clean, healthy place to live. Do people try to help out your community on their own free will, or is it required? At some private schools it is required to have a certain amount of community service hours in order to graduate, is it the same at yours? Here, there are some who go out of their way for others, or some that have to do it as a punishment for a crime.<br/>

We are not involved with helping out our community. We are required to do once a year at the house for the old. Some of us do that for their free will, and go out of their way for others. But I think it isn&rsquo;t popular around us, teenager.<br/>

<h4>[Live Video Conference]</h4>

<h4>[Home Stay]</h4>

<p>It is important for students to set up a chance to meet each other with face to face revel to increase their relationship built on the Internet. Physical feeling or contact like a scent which is never transferred through the Internet should be shared through the direct meeting. It will advance to learn cultural diversity and understanding and co-existence among different cultures.</p>
